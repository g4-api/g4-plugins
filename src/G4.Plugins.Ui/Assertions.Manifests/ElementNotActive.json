		"",
		"The `ElementNotActive` plugin is designed to assert that a specified web element is not active within a web browser during automated tasks. ",
		"Its primary goal is to ensure that automation scripts can validate the inactive state of elements, which is crucial for scenarios where specific elements must be inactive to proceed.",
