		"### Purpose",
		"",
		"The `PageUrl` plugin is designed to validate the URL of the current web page against specific conditions. ",
		"It provides a robust mechanism to assert that the page URL meets expected conditions, such as matching a particular pattern, containing specific segments, or being equal to a given URL.",

		"| URL Validation             | Validates the current page URL against expected conditions, supporting both exact matches and pattern-based checks. |",
		"| Regular Expression Support | Applies regular expressions to the URL before performing assertions, enabling complex validations.                  |",
		"| Flexible Assertions        | Supports a range of operators, including equality, inequality, and pattern matching, for versatile URL validation.  |",
