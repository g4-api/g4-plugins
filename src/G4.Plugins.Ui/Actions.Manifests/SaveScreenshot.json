		"| Verification and Debugging | Screenshots can be used for visual verification, ensuring that the application's interface matches the expected state. This is particularly useful in automated test cases where precise UI details matter.                     |",
		"| Documentation              | Screenshots serve as valuable documentation, providing a visual record of the application's behavior at different stages of the automation process. This aids in creating comprehensive reports for debugging and analysis.     |",
		"| Error Identification       | When an error occurs during the automation process, a saved screenshot at the point of failure can provide insights into the issue, making it easier for developers and testers to identify and address problems.               |",
		"| Visual Regression Testing  | Integral to visual regression testing, where screenshots taken during different test runs are compared to detect any unexpected visual changes in the application.                                                              |",
		"| Cross-Browser Testing      | For web applications, taking screenshots across different browsers helps ensure consistent rendering and user interface across various browser environments.                                                                    |",
