		"### Purpose",
		"",
		"The Put plugin lets automation workflows update or create an entire resource on a server or API with a single HTTP PUT request.",
		"It follows the standard HTTP protocol for full resource replacement or creation.",
		"The plugin makes these updates reliable and repeatable in any workflow.",
