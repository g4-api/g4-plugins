It supports alternative locators, nested loops, and exception logging to maintain reliable workflows in RPA and automated testing.",
				"qa": [
					{
						"question": "What is the InvokeForEachLoop plugin?",
						"answer": "It is an automation action that locates a set of elements using a locator and runs a series of child actions on each element in sequence."
					},
					{
						"question": "Why is InvokeForEachLoop useful?",
						"answer": "It simplifies repetitive tasks such as data processing or UI interaction testing by looping through elements automatically rather than scripting each action manually."
					},
					{
						"question": "What are the main features of InvokeForEachLoop?",
						"answer": "Key features include element iteration, sequential execution, alternative locator support, nested loop capability, and detailed exception logging."
					},
					{
						"question": "How do you specify which elements to iterate over?",
						"answer": "You set the locator (for example Xpath or CSS selector) and the onElement value to identify each item; to run on the full collection use onElement \".\" and omit locator."
					},
					{
						"question": "How do nested loops work in InvokeForEachLoop?",
						"answer": "Each InvokeForEachLoop processes its own element set independently; inner loops do not filter or inherit the outer loop's results."
					},
					{
						"question": "Can I pass the current element from the outer loop into the inner loop?",
						"answer": "No. Each loop independently queries the DOM and does not maintain a reference to another loop's current element. Sharing that context would require additional state management and element reference handling, which is beyond the plugin's design."
					},
					{
						"question": "How do I use CSS versus XPath locators with InvokeForEachLoop?",
						"answer": "Specify \"locator\": \"CssSelector\" or omit it for Xpath (the default). Then set onElement to the matching selector string for each strategy."
					},
					{
						"question": "What happens if onElement is set to \".\" without a locator?",
						"answer": "The plugin treats \".\" as the current context and processes all elements passed in from a previous action or the root context when no locator is provided."
					},
					{
						"question": "Where are exceptions recorded when an action within the loop fails?",
						"answer": "Exceptions are added to the response payload and the log stream under the extractions or errors section, but the loop continues by default."
					},
					{
						"question": "How do I configure the loop to stop on error?",
						"answer": "You must set the workflow's stop-on-error flag in the parent container or action settings, as the plugin itself does not stop execution by default."
					},
					{
						"question": "How do I define a Click action inside the InvokeForEachLoop?",
						"answer": "Add a child rule with \"$type\": \"Action\", \"pluginName\": \"Click\", and set onElement to \".\" to act on the current loop item."
					},
					{
						"question": "Which categories and platforms does this plugin support?",
						"answer": "It is categorized under Loops, supports Any platform, and is defined as an Action pluginType."
					},
					{
						"question": "How can you run the plugin on the entire collection without a locator?",
						"answer": "Set onElement to \".\" and remove the locator entry so that actions apply to every item found by the parent rule."
					},
					{
						"question": "Who authored the CopyParameter plugin?",
						"answer": "The plugin was authored by Roei Sabag."
					},
					{
						"question": "Where can I find the source code and documentation for InvokeForEachLoop?",
						"answer": "Source code: https://github.com/g4-api/g4-plugins/blob/main/src/G4.Plugins.Common/Actions/InvokeForEachLoop.cs; Docs: https://github.com/g4-api/g4-plugins/blob/main/docs/Actions/InvokeForEachLoop.md"

		"",
		"The InvokeForEachLoop plugin finds all elements matching your locator and runs a set of actions on each one. To operate on the entire collection, set onElement to \".\" and omit the locator.
